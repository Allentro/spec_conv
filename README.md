## Spec Conv 
spec_conv is python wrapper of a c script developed by C.Wheldon for conversion of gamma spectrum files. 

This python module aims to enable the use of spec_conv through python both as an import or a command line to as originally designed of spec_conv. 

An extra feature which has been added to the python module is the ability to convert all spectrum files recursively within a directory tree with a single command.
